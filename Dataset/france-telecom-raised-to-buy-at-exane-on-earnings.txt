should buy  <markup>France Telecom  SA</markup> shares, the first time in almost five
years the brokerage has recommended the stock, predicting a ``wave
of earnings upgrades'' for the country's biggest phone company.

estimate on the shares to 28 euros apiece from 25 euros
previously. The last  time  he rated the stock ``outperform'' was
in October 2003, <markup>Bloomberg</markup> data show.  
 Paris-based <markup>France Telecom</markup> will also benefit from ``new
signs of consolidation in the industry,'' the report said.  
 The shares gained 16 cents, or 0.7 percent, to 24.92 euros
as of 9:58 a.m. in Paris, after earlier climbing 3 percent to as
