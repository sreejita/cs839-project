sandwich chain, appointed former <markup>Burger King</markup> Chief Executive
Officer Greg Brenneman as president and CEO, effective
immediately.  
 <markup>TurnWorks Inc</markup>., Brenneman's private-equity firm, has taken

statement without being more specific. Brenneman replaced
Richard E. Schaden, who will remain chairman of the company.

left the company to return to <markup>TurnWorks</markup> Inc., though remained
as a consultant until June 30. He said <markup>Quiznos</markup> had no plans to
go public.

purchased by <markup> Texas Pacific Group</markup>, <markup>Bain Capital LLC</markup> and 
<markup>Goldman Sachs Capital Partners</markup> in December 2002 from
