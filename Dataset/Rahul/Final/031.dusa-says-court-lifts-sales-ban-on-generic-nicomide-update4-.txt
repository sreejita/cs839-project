<markup>Dusa Pharmaceuticals</markup> said a
federal judge lifted a ban on sales of a generic version of the
acne treatment Nicomide by <markup>River's Edge Pharmaceuticals LLC</markup>.
Dusa's shares fell 10 percent.  

 <markup>River's Edge</markup> lawyer Diane Stolbach said the Suwanee,
Georgia-based company plans to begin selling generic Nicomide
immediately. <markup>Dusa</markup>, based in Wilmington,  Massachusetts , said it
will pursue patent-infringement claims against <markup>River's Edge</markup>.  
 U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler in  Newark , New Jersey,
imposed the ban in May after <markup>Dusa</markup> sued <markup>River</markup> 's Edge. He lifted
the order yesterday after finding that there was ``a substantial
question of validity'' regarding <markup>Dusa</markup> 's patent and the company
was unlikely to win at trial on the infringement claims.  

 Chesler's decision was based in part on a review by the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, rejected the patent in a
preliminary finding. Stolbach, of Kraemer, Burns, Mytelka,
Lovell & Kulka in Springfield, New Jersey, said <markup>River's Edge</markup> was
pleased by the ruling.
