<markup>ACE Aviation Holdings Inc</markup>. (ACE/H)  must give
raises to pilots at <markup>Air Canada</markup>, the country's largest airline,
and flight attendants at the company's regional carrier, two
arbitrators ruled.  
 The 3,100 pilots represented by the <markup>Air Canada</markup> Pilots
Association will get a 2 percent wage increase effective July
2006, 1.75 percent in July 2007 and 1.75 percent in July 2008 in
a settlement handed down by arbitrator Douglas Stanley,
Montreal-based <markup>ACE</markup> said today in a statement.  
 The pilot award is the third arbitrated settlement for <markup>Air Canada</markup>, 
 which had scheduled wage talks with all its major labor
groups this year. Mechanics received 5 percent over three years
in an August settlement, and sales and service employees got a
4.5 percent wage increase over the same period in a July award.  
 Jazz, the regional airline 80 percent owned by <markup>ACE</markup>, must
pay the 740 flight attendants represented by Teamsters Canada 1
percent more effective July 2006, 1.75 percent on July 2007 and
1.75 percent on July 2008, Halifax-based Jazz said today in a
statement. The raises were ordered by arbitrator Michel Picher,
matching those he issued to 1,660 other Jazz employees in July.  
 <markup>ACE</markup> is awaiting an arbitrated settlement with the Canadian
Union of Public Employees, which represents 6,000 <markup>Air Canada</markup>
flight attendants.  
 Shares of <markup>ACE</markup> fell C$2.51, or 6.5 percent, to C$36.24 at

 Units of Jazz Air Income Fund, which owns 20 percent of

after the Canadian government said yesterday it planned to tax
income trusts. Income trusts avoid paying most corporate taxes
