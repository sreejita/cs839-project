Mercantile Exchange.  

 ``The Russian market has lately been driven almost entirely
by the oil price, and today is no different,'' said John Heisel,
a trader at Moscow-based <markup>Sovlink Securities</markup>. ``We see crude up
slightly on speculation supply will tighten, and speculative
money is piling into liquid oil names, pushing our market up.''
