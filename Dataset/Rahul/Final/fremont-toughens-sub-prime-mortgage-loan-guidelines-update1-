<markup>Fremont Investment & Loan</markup>, the third-largest provider of sub-prime U.S. mortgages through brokers, is
making broad changes to its lending guidelines for at least the
second time within a year to reflect concerns about rising late
payments by the riskiest borrowers.  
 The lender will stop giving mortgages to individuals who
can't prove their income when buying a home with no money down,
or to those that make down payments of less than 10 percent for
properties sold without real estate agents, according to an
internal memo. Fremont Investment, the main operating unit of
 Santa Monica , California-based <markup>Fremont General Corp<markup>., will also
refuse to refinance loans that are more than 90 days late.  
 ``Change can be difficult for everyone, but in the current
market, change is necessary,'' Robert Clafford, a senior vice
president at Fremont, wrote in the memo, which outlined 11 areas
where the company would tighten standards. Clafford declined to
comment about the memo when reached by telephone yesterday.  
 A slowing housing market and looser underwriting has pushed
delinquencies on sub-prime mortgages made in 2005 and 2006 to
the worst levels for their ages since loans originated in 2001,
according <markup>UBS AG</markup> and <markup>Friedman Billings Ramsey Group Inc</markup>. Sub-prime mortgages are considered the riskiest types because they
are made to people with poor or limited credit histories.  
 Other lenders have also clamped down on lending practices
within the past month, including <markup>New Century Financial Corp</markup>.,
<markup>General Electric Co</markup>.'s WMC Mortgage, and <markup>First Franklin
Financial</markup>, which Merrill Lynch & Co. bought this month.
